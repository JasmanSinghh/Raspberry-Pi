# Raspberry-Pi

This project was done with a combination of Buttons, LEDâ€™s, 7-Segment, Distance Sensor, and Buzzer. I
created a game where you must stay still during the red light, and you can move freely when it is lit
green. Now if you move and set of the distance sensor the buzzer will play indicating that you have
moved and the led will start to blink along with the number going on the 7 segment going down. I also
added a gui program where you can select a number of players from a range of 1 to 9.
